        <mark>On the tomb of Lamarck, his daughter made the inscription: "You will be
        avenged." How much these words say. The professors of the famous Newton
        were forced to flee to the officials. The same thing happened with our
        Mendeleyev: he left the university still in the power. Cuvier pursued
        Lamarck and proclaimed him with his fellow academics an idiot.
        The great manuscript of Newton lay unheeded and was printed many years
        after its writing. Edison wandered for a long time in poverty, not
        finding the application hidden in her forces. The same was with the
        famous Burbank. All this continues to be done now, especially in such
        uncultured countries as old Russia. Great deeds were done not by jury
        scientists, but people, in the generally accepted sense, are small.
        Such are, for example, the artilleryman Engelhardt and the great Liebig
        who did not finish high school and fell into the professors only thanks
        to the patronage and connections of Humboldt.</mark>

      <mark>Life in higher organisms is like a dream, and life in higher animals,
      althought terrifying (from the  point of view of man) but subjectively
      inconsiderate. A cow, a sheep, a horse or a monkey does not feel her
      humiliation, as now feels the humiliation of his life. But the higher
      beings look at a person with regret, as we are on dogs or rats.</mark>
