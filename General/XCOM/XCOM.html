      <blockquote class="green">
      Life in higher organisms is like a dream, and life in higher animals,
      althought terrifying (from the  point of view of man) but subjectively
      inconsiderate. A cow, a sheep, a horse or a monkey does not feel her
      humiliation, as now feels the humiliation of his life. But the higher
      beings look at a person with regret, as we are on dogs or rats.
